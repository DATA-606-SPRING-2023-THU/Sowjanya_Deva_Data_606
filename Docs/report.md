# Project Title : Flight Delay Prediction
# Introduction
Flight delays cause inconvenience to passengers, impact airline operations, and result in financial losses. 
The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the probability of flight delays based on various factors such as historical flight data, weather conditions, airport congestion, and airline-specific information.
By predicting delays in advance, airlines can proactively manage their resources, minimize disruptions, and improve customer satisfaction.
By predicting delays in advance, airlines can proactively manage their resources, minimize disruptions, and improve customer satisfaction.
# Motivation
Flight Delay has negative impact on business reputation and demand of airlines as well. Business Problem Overview
Develop a  business model to predict flight delays. Reduce further economic loss for airlines.Lessen inconvenience occurred to passengers.
# Moto
- The objective of flight delay prediction is to develop a reliable and accurate model that can forecast the likelihood and duration of flight delays.
- The model aims to utilize historical flight data, weather information, airport conditions, and other relevant factors to make predictions.
- The prediction model should consider various variables such as departure/arrival time, airline, aircraft type, route, and external factors like weather conditions.
- The goal is to provide timely and actionable information to airlines, passengers, and airport authorities to mitigate the impact of delays and improve overall travel experience.
